## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing COVID-19 data using Python and visualizing key insights through a Power BI dashboard. The objective is to better understand the global and regional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining trends, patterns, and key metrics.

## 💻 Technologies Used
### Python:
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-plotly

* Power BI:* For interactive dashboard creation.
* Jupyter Notebook:* For running and sharing Python scripts.
** Git: **For version control and collaboration.

## 📊 Data Source
The data utilized in this project is sourced from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data Repository, which provides daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
The raw data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and consistency:

Handling Missing Values: Addressed gaps and inconsistencies in the data.
Data Normalization: Standardized formats (e.g., date, time).
Aggregation: Summarized data by country/region.
Feature Engineering: Created new variables (e.g., daily increase in cases).

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
### Key aspects explored include:

Global Trends: Analysis of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
Regional Analysis: In-depth examination of specific countries/regions.
Correlation Analysis: Identified relationships between various metrics.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard offers an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore:

Global and Regional Case Trends: Understand the spread of the pandemic.
Daily Metrics: Track new cases and deaths on a daily basis.
Country-Specific Analysis: Dive into the data of individual countries.
Key Statistics: Highlight crucial metrics and insights.
