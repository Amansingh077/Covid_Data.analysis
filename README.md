## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing COVID-19 data using Python and visualizing key insights through a Power BI dashboard. The objective is to better understand the global and regional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining trends, patterns, and key metrics.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Python**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboard creation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and sharing Python scripts.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## 📊 Data Source
The data utilized in this project is sourced from the [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), which provides daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
The raw data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and consistency:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed gaps and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Data Normalization**: Standardized formats (e.g., date, time).
- **Aggregation**: Summarized data by country/region.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new variables (e.g., daily increase in cases).

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
Key aspects explored include:
- **Global Trends**: Analysis of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
- **Regional Analysis**: In-depth examination of specific countries/regions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between various metrics.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard offers an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore:
- **Global and Regional Case Trends**: Understand the spread of the pandemic.
- **Daily Metrics**: Track new cases and deaths on a daily basis.
- **Country-Specific Analysis**: Dive into the data of individual countries.
- **Key Statistics**: Highlight crucial metrics and insights.
