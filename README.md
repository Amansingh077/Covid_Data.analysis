Project Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data using Python and visualize key insights through a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to understand the trends, patterns, and overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and regionally.

Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard
Jupyter Notebook: For running the Python scripts
Git: Version control
Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from Johns Hopkins University, which provides daily updates on global COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.

Data Preprocessing
The raw data underwent several preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values
Normalizing data formats (e.g., date and time)
Aggregating data by country/region
Creating new features for analysis (e.g., daily increase in cases)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Key aspects explored include:

Global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries
Region-specific analysis to understand the spread and impact
Correlation analysis to identify potential relationships between different variables
Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of:

Global and regional case trends
Daily new cases and deaths
Country-specific analysis
Key statistics and metrics
